This repository contains bunch of solutions for algorithms and data structures exercises/tasks/interview questions (or whatever they are called).  

Most of them are from sites like LeetCode or Codility, so they can be easily searchable.  

In the `interviews` directory I store all the interview questions I had in past and solution for them.
I do it only for companies that I have not signed any NDAs or any similar stuff, and I'm not feeling guilty by sharing them.

**Note: Please take this repository with grain of salt. Solutions stored in this repo are for sure not a state of the art, nor commit message, nor anything else.**
